CISA also recommends reviewing hosts with potentially risky open services (e.g. RDP, Telnet, etc.), especially if they are functioning as networked management interfaces, to ensure that each service is intended to be available to the public and, where applicable, the service is up-to-date on the latest version, correctly configured, and uses strong authentication.

{{#is_federal}}As part of BOD 23-02, networked management interfaces exposed to the public internet must either be shut off or protected by capabilities that enforce access control to the interface through a policy enforcement point separate from the interface itself as part of a Zero Trust Architecture within 14 days.{{/is_federal}}

The details are in the attached PDF, which has the same password as your weekly Cyber Hygiene Vulnerability Scanning report.
