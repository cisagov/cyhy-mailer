Cyber Hygiene scans of your host(s) conducted in the past day have detected one or both of the following:
* New critical and/or high vulnerabilities
* New potentially risky services

CISA recommends remediating critical findings within 15 days and high findings within 30 days.

CISA also recommends reviewing hosts with potentially risky open services (e.g. RDP, Telnet, etc.) to ensure that each service is intended to be available to the public and, where applicable, the service is up-to-date on the latest version, correctly configured, and uses strong authentication.

The details are in the attached PDF, which has the same password as your Cyber Hygiene report.
